# What is this?

This folder holds various development tooling/scripts and temporary files.
Everything in here is Git-ignored by default, so put whatever you want in here.

**Activating.** Use `source dev/bin/activate` to:

- Add `dev/bin` to your PATH.
- Set GOPATH to `dev/go`.
- Include `.env` into your current shell.

Activating is just a convenience and not needed for building/developing the project.
