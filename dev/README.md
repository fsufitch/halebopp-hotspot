# What is this?

This folder holds various development tooling/scripts and temporary files.
Everything in here is Git-ignored by default, so put whatever you want in here.

**Activating.** The dev directory contains a way to isolate your GOPATH from the global/user one (for ease of cleanup, etc), and to include `dev/bin/` into your shell environment. Use `source dev/bin/activate` to do so.
